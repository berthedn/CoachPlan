Description :

Coach Plan is an application that will make collaboration between a coach and his athlete easier.

This application will allow the coach to plan his athleteâ€™s workouts throughout the week.

The athlete will be able to have access to his workout on the application without the need to reaching out to his coach.

Run the program :

To use the application you should just run the program as an application from the file CoachPlanApplication.java

The first page on which you are going to land is index.html
The Login interface is now WORKING.

You need to create an account as a Coach if you want to acces the interface.(working)
