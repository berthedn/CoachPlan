Description :

Coach Plan is an application that will make collaboration between a coach and his athlete easier.

This application will allow the coach to plan his athleteâ€™s workouts throughout the week.

The athlete will be able to have access to his workout on the application without the need to reaching out to his coach.

To use the application you should just run the program as an application from the file CoachPlanApplication.java
